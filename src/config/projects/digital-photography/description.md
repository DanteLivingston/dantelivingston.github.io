This is a series of many works of digital photography I completed as a part of my Photo 40 class. It was my first exposure to digital photography outside of just using something as simple as my phone and was a great introduction to the medium. Through digital photography I found myself able to freely express my love for nature on a different level than ever before. Whether it is going on small hikes around my house, or taking the camera out with me whenever I go camping, Iâ€™ve found that there are always opportunities to take great photographs.

I have also brought my digital photography into my digital illustration and 3D work. By utilizing my own photographs as reference, or background images for texture information I am more freely able to sidestep any potential copyright issues while still making use of the same techniques that many professional digital artists employ.

For all of these photographs, I used a **[Canon EOS Rebel T3](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-rebel-t3/eos-rebel-t3)** with a 55mm lens. It has been extremely effective and versatile for all of my work and coupled with an editing program like Adobe Lightroom I am able to get the best results. Some of the images shown have been lightly edited, cropped and color graded, while others are raw giving them a good amount of technical range.
