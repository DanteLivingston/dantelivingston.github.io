const description = `<p>This project consists of a single sculpture made from recyclable and self forged materials. It is meant to showcase the ongoing pollution of our oceans by giving you a view into a cross section of a shark filled with plastic and metal waste. I have always been a huge proponent of environmentalism and after seeing projects like <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">The Ocean Cleanup</a></strong> take effect I wanted to broadcast some of my own perspectives through my art. The work itself was made as said above, entirely of recyclable materials like plastic bags and an old shark toy. The small metal cans and bottles are casted tin which was made from a series of hand carved molds.</p>
