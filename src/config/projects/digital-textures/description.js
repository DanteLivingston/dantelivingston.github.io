const description = `<p>These are a series of texture assets I have made in the program <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href="https://quixel.com/mixer">Quixel Mixer</a></strong>. Mixer is an alternative to programs like substance painter that has seen a quick and steady rise in terms of its use in triple A movie and game projects. I have always appreciated the insane detail you can find in something as simple as a broken brick wall in modern video games to the point that I had to attempt something similar myself.</p>

<p>This was a personal project that really showed me that even as a single person with limited experience in 3D I could create something photoreal. It also gave me a newfound respect for the texture and environment artists that are often forgotten about as the time you can spend on a floor texture compared to how long someone will actually view it is incomparable. This project also taught me one last lesson in terms of the scope of triple A titles. While I might be able to make textures, 3D models, concept art and some other assets, there are still so many things I am completely unable to do. When working on personal projects now I have very much limited my scope to make them at least realistically doable instead of picturing a whole moden game coming out of my computer alone.</p>
