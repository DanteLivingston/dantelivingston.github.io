  <h1>This is a collection of Photoshop and Illustrator work.</h1>
  <p>This was all created before my newest class, Art74 making it some of my first introduction to the Adobe Suite Programs. The work was mostly all done for school, but there was a good amount of experimentation and freedom given to me to make it my own.</p>

      <h2>Miniatures</h2>
      <h5>This was an image I worked on in Photoshop to give it a miniature / anamorphic feel like it was a model set. I really like how it turned out as it was completely new to me, however I have always loved miniatures so being able to create them from scratch was a great project.</h5>
      <div class="Miniature">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="miniature.PNG" alt="MINI1">
	  </div>
      <p>This consists of a large ammount of images that show off different principles of design. They go over tyopographic elements like font, text size, etc. Color combinations, visual equilibrium, contrast, symmetry and many more design elements.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Real World Crest Ad</h2>
      <h5>This was another school project where we were tasked with creating a new flavor of toothpaste and putting a design on the crest box. I made an Orange flavored toothpaste, I'm sure it would be wonderful! This was a more fun project where we had a bit of creative freedom, because of this I created a supposedly horrible tasting toothpaste!</h5>
      <div class="AllofCrest">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="crestbox.JPEG" alt="Box1">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="crestboxflavor.JPEG" alt="Box2">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="crestadd.JPEG" alt="CrestAd">
	  </div>
      <p>This project was meant to show new designers some elements of design that are easy to find in the real world. We looked on campus for the time being and took pictures of the different elements of design.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>Snowing Mountain<h2>
	  <h5>Minor Photoshop Snow Effect Test</h5>
      <div class="Mountain">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="snowmountain.JPEG" alt="Mount1">
	  </div>
      <p>This was something I worked on in Photoshop. In the beginning the mountain picture was clear and I added a snow layer to it trying to create a semi-realistic effect. This was a good way for me to play around with Photoshop and first learn the ability that the tool has given me.</p>
	  <br>
      <p>I used Illustrator to create a series of Color Wheels and Color Vector test which are used when working with a multitude of color to help designers get a better picture of how to use them in their space.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>LandScapes and Cityscapes</h2>
      <h5>A small series of landscapes and cityscapes I created in Illustrator</h5>
      <div class="Land/CityScapes">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="landscape1.PNG" alt="LandScape">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="cityscape1.PNG" alt="CityScape">
	  </div>
      <p>This was a series of Landscapes and Cityscapes I created in a cartoony feel. They were made with some of Illustrator's basic drawing tools where I tried to create some more detailed drawings that could be used as background.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>My First Logo</h2>
      <h5>This was the first Logo I ever created for myself!</h5>
      <div class="ColorLogos">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="logo1.PNG" alt="LogoRed">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="logo2.PNG" alt="LogoYellow">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="logo3.PNG" alt="LogoGreen">
	  </div>
      <p>I suppose it's more of a piece of history than anything else, as it was the first logo I ever created for myself. I did it in a small series of colors to help me see what options I have. I used a variety of typographic elements to help me as well with the different text issues. </p>
