const description = `<p>This project was fairly unique for me as it involved making an interactive art piece centered on a score and it was also a group project. I worked together with my fellow SJSU Students, Elizabeth Nguyen, Sam Shi and Giovanny Lopez. The team and myself had never worked with music and interactive art. This was absolutely a project that brought me quite a bit of growth. The audio itself is meant to be a series of sounds you might hear doing everyday “office work” and were meant to be obtained all in a single room. The interactive section of the piece then comes into effect as while you are listening to the music, you will also be filling out a short form. It was intended to feel monotonous and a bit like data entry with the music in the background to further add to the effect.</p>

<p>If you would like to try it yourself, I won’t spoil too much and will instead leave the link to the form you can fill out while listening below.</p>
