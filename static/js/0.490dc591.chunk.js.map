description = `<p>These are a series of texture assets I have made in the program <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://quixel.com/mixer\">Quixel Mixer</a></strong>. Mixer is an alternative to programs like substance painter that has seen a quick and steady rise in terms of its use in triple A movie and game projects. I have always appreciated the insane detail you can find in something as simple as a broken brick wall in modern video games to the point that I had to attempt something similar myself.</p>\n\n<p>This was a personal project that really showed me that even as a single person with limited experience in 3D I could create something photo-real. It also gave me a newfound respect for the texture and environment artists that are often forgotten about as the time you can spend on a floor texture compared to how long someone will actually view it is incomparable. This project also taught me one last lesson in terms of the scope of triple A titles. While I might be able to make textures, 3D models, concept art and some other assets, there are still so many things I am completely unable to do. When working on personal projects now I have very much limited my scope to make them at least realistically doable instead of picturing a whole modern game coming out of my computer alone.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone interested in the more technical aspect of how these textures are made to look photo-real, I will explain here in a bit more detail. Each individual texture has two corresponding 3D and 2D photos, they are all made with a variety of maps including, Albedo, Diffuse, Specular, Gloss, Roughness, Normal, Displacement, AO and Metalness. These are meant to exponentially increase the texture’s fidelity by providing the most realistic form of lighting, shading and texture information. The final textures are also made with a variety of photorealistic <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://quixel.com/megascans\">Megascans </a></strong> from Quixel’s library giving them a photo-real starting point that you then take further.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Links to Programs Used:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'

The audio itself is meant to be a series of sounds you might hear doing everyday “office work” and were meant to be obtained all in a single room.

This effect is mainly dependent on the high depth of field and blur to give off a different perspective than the image had originally. Color adjustments were also made in order to sell the miniature vibe as many dioramas of cityscapes have much more vibrant painterly colors than they would in real life.</p>\n\n<p>The second image is originally of a snowy mountain without the snow overlay effects. This was meant as a way for me to demonstrate the control Photoshop has in that you are able to change the lighting and weather completely without disrupting the original image. The effect, much like the miniature is fairly simple with the overlay itself being a noise map with effects added on to make it more realistic.

Feng Zhu places an emphasis on understanding the fundamentals in order to ultimately create the best design possible. I have been heavily influenced by not only his art, but his way of thinking and have tried to bring much of his thought process into my own work. While he does still work on many high profile projects, he also runs an art school, the FZD School of Design which he founded in Singapore.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Links</p>\n\n<ul><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://fzdschool.com/\">Feng Zhu School of Design</a></p></li><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL\">Feng Zhu&#39;s Youtube Channel</a></p></li><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fengzhudesign/?hl=en\">Feng Zhu&#39;s Instagram</a></p></li><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://twitter.com/FengZhuDesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Feng Zhu&#39;s Twitter</a></p></li></ul>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_PFP.4801c1e8.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_Work_01.c54d1e2a.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_Work_02.8d6c59ea.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_Work_03.84262c36.jpg\";","import description from './description';\r\n\r\nimport jeanMoebiusPFP from './images/JeanGiraud_PFP.jpg';\r\nimport jeanMoebiusCharacter from './images/JeanGiraud_Work_01.jpg';\r\nimport jeanMoebiusLandscape from './images/JeanGiraud_Work_02.jpg';\r\nimport jeanMoebiusDesert from './images/JeanGiraud_Work_03.jpg';\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n  slug: 'jean-giraud',\r\n  title: 'Jean Giraud \"Moebius\"',\r\n  shortDescription:\r\n    'A French surrealist comic who has worked with Stan Lee and insipired Hayao Miyazaki.',\r\n  description,\r\n  type: 'inspiration',\r\n  splashImageUrl: jeanMoebiusPFP,\r\n  images: [\r\n    {\r\n      url: jeanMoebiusCharacter,\r\n      title: 'Starwatcher Holding a Crystal',\r\n      description:\r\n        'Some of Moebius’ character art that shows his ability to go from blank shapes to areas of very high detail.

They are unique in that they are my first foray into sculpture in entirety unless you count dioramas and miniatures. The sculptures were meant to showcase that even when making something with the bare minimum in terms of materials, you could still create something unique and detailed.</p>\n\n<p>The first sculpture was a simple wire ball to get us familiar with the tools and medium and was meant as a stepping stone to our later sculpture. I found this pretty fun to make overall as it gave me the opportunity to work with my hands which I had been doing less and less as the digital side of my college career was taking up more of my time.</p>\n\n<p>The second sculpture is a replica of a small desktop fan I have and it was originally able to stand up on it’s own. However due to having it move across the state it is a little worse for wear. This piece was very challenging to me, as the wire was fairly greasy and the smaller gauge was especially hard to manipulate because of this. Ultimately, the sculpture came out well in the end and really showed off the form of the fan almost exactly to what the original was.</p>\n\n<hr/>`\nexport default description\n","import description from './description';\r\n\r\nimport bigRedImage from './images/big-red-image.jpg';\r\nimport smallOrangeImage from './images/small-orange-image.jpg';\r\nimport smallRedImage from './images/small-red-image.png';\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n  slug: 'tools',\r\n  title: 'Tools',\r\n  shortDescription: 'These are some of my favorite tools',\r\n  description,\r\n  type: 'tools',\r\n  splashImageUrl: smallOrangeImage,\r\n  images: [\r\n    {\r\n      url: bigRedImage,\r\n      title: 'Photoshop',\r\n      description: 'lorem ipsum foobar magna vulputate',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: smallOrangeImage,\r\n      title: 'iPad',\r\n      description: 'lorem ipsum foobar ridiculus mus',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: smallRedImage,\r\n      title: 'quisque ut',\r\n      description: 'lorem ipsum foobar quisque ut',\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default config;\r\n","const description = `<h1>H1 Header</h1>\n\n<h2>H2</h2>\n\n<h3>H3</h3>\n\n<p>I am <strong>bold</strong> text</p>\n\n<p>I am <em>italicized</em> text</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I am block quote</p></blockquote>\n\n<ol><li>first</li><li>second</li><li><p>third</p></li><li><p>first</p></li><li>second</li><li>third</li></ol>\n\n<p><code>i am code</code></p>\n\n<p>Horizontal rule below</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Link to <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a></p>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/big-red-image.e6e69f84.jpg\";","export default \"data:image/png;base64,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\"","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/MossyRocks_3D.56c9ab78.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/WireBall.5a14256b.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
