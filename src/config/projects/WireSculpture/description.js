const description = `<p>This is a series of two sculptures I made when beginning to work with wire as a medium. The first sculpture was a simple wire ball to get myself familiar with the tools and medium and was meant as a stepping stone to our later sculpture. I found this pretty fun to make overall as it gave me the opportunity to work with my hands which I had been doing less and less as the digital side of my college career was taking up more of my time. They are my first real foray into sculpture in entirety aside from creating the occasional diorama. The sculptures were meant to be a sort of real world wire frame or line drawing equivalent. I found this effect fairly amusing to create, as the process involved me somewhat literally tracing a three dimensional fan.</p>
