This was a project originally composed for my Art 24 class. It was my first time drawing with a quill and actual ink so it was a fun learning process. We utilized **[bamboo reed pens](https://www.amazon.com/Jack-Richeson-Strong-Bamboo-medium/dp/B0042ST57A)** and **[India Ink](https://www.amazon.com/Speedball-2-Ounce-India-Super-Black/dp/B0007ZJ8TM)** to make the art which were both much easier to use than I originally imagined. The works themselves are all fundamentally studies of black and white composition, value and form of plants in vases that you would traditionally see in any drawing class. I found the ink blotching frustrating to deal with at first, however later I saw it as another way to express the uniqueness of the medium itself and began to try and take advantage of it in some pieces. I am a huge fan of the ink aesthetic and drawing traditionally, so this was very fun to work on as well as being informative.
