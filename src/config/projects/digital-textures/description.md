These are a series of textures I have made in the program **[Quixel Mixer](https://quixel.com/mixer)** to explore the process of making a photoreal digital project. I have always appreciated the immense detail you can find in something as simple as a broken brick wall and when creating these textures for myself, it reminded me of how much effort can go into each aspect of a project. This showed me that even as a single person with limited experience, I could create something photo-real. It also gave me a newfound respect for the texture and environment artists that are often forgotten about as the time you can spend on a texture compared to how long someone will view it is incomparable.

For anyone interested in the more technical aspect of how these textures are made to look photo-real, I will explain here in a bit more detail. Each individual texture has two corresponding 3D and 2D photos, they are all made with a variety of maps including, Albedo, Diffuse, Specular, Gloss, Roughness, Normal, Displacement, AO and Metalness. These are meant to exponentially increase the texture’s fidelity by providing the most realistic form of lighting, shading and texture information. The final textures are also made with a variety of photorealistic **[Megascans ](https://quixel.com/megascans)** from Quixel’s library giving them a photo-real starting point that you then take further.
