const description = `<p>This project consists of a single sculpture made from recyclable and self forged materials originally for my Art 13 class. It is meant to showcase the ongoing pollution of our oceans by giving you a view into a cross section of a shark filled with plastic and metal waste. I have always been a huge proponent of environmentalism and after seeing projects like <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href="https://theoceancleanup.com/">The Ocean Cleanup</a></strong> take effect I wanted to broadcast some of my own perspectives through my art.</p>

<p>The work itself was made as said above, entirely of recyclable materials like plastic bags and an old shark toy. The small metal cans and bottles were made in a way completely new to me. We were able to cast them ourselves in a crucible after making plaster molds in which to form them. This was a super interesting and fun experience for me especially since I have no idea when the next time I will be able to do metal casting will be.</p>
