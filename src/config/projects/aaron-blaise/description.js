const description = `<p>Aaron Blaise is a creature artist who got his early break working at Disney on movies like The Lion King, Pocahontas and Mulan. He has superb animation and drawing skills, however his ability to render creatures in photoreal detail is almost more impressive to look at. His love for the outdoors is something I wholeheartedly share and the sheer range of his artwork is something I respect so much. Without knowing about him as an individual, my earliest years were undoubtedly influenced by Aaron Blaiseâ€™s work on a deep level. Aaron Blaise now runs an online art school, &quot;CreatureArtTeacher&quot; as a way to share his skills and techniques with others and frequently posts free tutorials on Youtube and other platforms.</p>
