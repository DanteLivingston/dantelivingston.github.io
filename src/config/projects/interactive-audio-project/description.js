const description = `<p>This project was fairly unique for me as it involved making an interactive art piece centered on a score. I have rarely worked with interactive art other than working on real miniatures and 3D modeling which I do not have a huge amount of experience with. In regards to the music making, I also had zero experience whatsoever, this was absolutely a project that brought me quite a bit of growth. The audio itself is meant to be a series of sounds you might hear doing everyday “office work” and were meant to be obtained all in a single room. The interactive section of the piece then comes into effect as while you are listening to the music, you will also be filling out a short form. It was intended to feel monotonous and a bit like data entry with the music in the background to further add to the effect.</p>

<p>If you would like to try it yourself, I won’t spoil too much and will instead leave the link to the form you can fill out while listening below.</p>

<p>As for how I was able to make this, I learned the basics of <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href="https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Adobe Audition</a></strong> and mixed my own recordings of a variety of “office work” sounds. This was a difficult process for me as I know next to nothing when it comes to music theory, however it was still very fun to do. This was a group project that I completed with my fellow Art 110 Students, Elizabeth Nguyen, Sam Shi and Giovanny Lopez. I created the initial idea for the project and they all contributed ¾ of the audio clips, Elizabeth also created the form and came up with the data entry idea. I created the last quarter of the sounds as well as mixed them into the final score.</p>
