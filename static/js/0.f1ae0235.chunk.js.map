description = `<p>Aaron Blaise is a creature artist who got his early break working at Disney on movies like The Lion King, Pocahontas and Mulan. He has superb animation and drawing skills, however his ability to render creatures in photoreal detail is almost more impressive to look at. His love for the outdoors is something I wholeheartedly share and the sheer range of his artwork is something I respect so much. Without knowing about him as an individual, my earliest years were undoubtedly influenced by Aaron Blaise’s work on a deep level.

I have always wanted to push towards digital illustration and to improve my skills. However after plenty of attempts with little success translating what I knew from traditional drawing into digital results I would quickly give up. Eventually, my parents ended up getting an Ipad with an <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></strong> for themselves, only for me to find it and start drawing. While before my digital art never looked as good as what I could accomplish in traditional, I was able to fully realize myself digitally within these pieces. They were drawn with an Apple pencil through the program <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://procreate.art/\">Procreate</a></strong>, as Photoshop on the Ipad is nowhere near as good as the desktop version from what I’ve seen. The characters themselves are all from the Japanese Anime “Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!” which translated to “God’s Blessing on this Wonderful world”, I do not claim for any of their designs to be my own or original. I have always loved the style of animation in it’s colorful nature and fluidity, as well as it’s simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>I first drew Aqua, the goddess with blue hair using the show’s promotional art as reference and made an effort to make a study of it by mimicking things like cell shading, poses, etc. She was the first piece of digital illustration art I have ever made and ultimately, I think she turned out well, but there were definitely lessons taught to me through the process of drawing. I would later iterate and experiment with the next two pieces, the red robed girl, Megumin and yellow armored crusader Darkness. For both of them I attempted to use a more realistic shading method to make them much less stylized. I also created unique poses for them to give them more motion and dynamism as well as to add my own flair. For Kazuma, the green rogue is at the moment my most recent piece, I pushed what I had learned previously even further. I wanted to experiment with more lighting options including using layers to my advantage as well as to really refine my core shading to create a more realistic look. I thought he was fairly successful in the end and shows off some of the growth I have been able to achieve with the limited time I have been working on digital illustration as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Kazuma as well as Darkness and the group image are all works in progress at the moment that I would like to iterate on further. However I wanted to showcase them all together for composition purposes as well as to show my growth.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<ul><li><p>Link to the <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://konosuba.fandom.com/wiki/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo!_Wiki\">KonoSubarashii Wiki</a></p></li><li><p>Link to <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></p></li><li><p>Link to <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://procreate.art/\">Procreate</a></p></li></ul>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Konosuba_Kazuma_web.88217924.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Konosuba_Megumin_web.4e270c8d.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Adjusted3_7375.541332b3.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Adjusted4_7456.3ed6620e.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7131.73119e39.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7145.d556f109.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7196.4b9b6244.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7229.94ea0244.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7254.17741587.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7281.34fabea1.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7305.72f3f69e.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7397.0876288c.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7436.8de8e072.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/IMG_7460.31d78241.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Livingston_CornerOfFrame_6506.69bcba10.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Livingston_LeadingLines_6369.465e5a36.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Livingston_VisceralPrint-6812.7909ef64.jpg\";","import description from './description';\nimport largeAloe from './images/Adjusted3_7375.jpg';\nimport wavySky from './images/Adjusted4_7456.jpg';\n//import natureHike from './images/IMG_7103.jpg';\n//import natureHikeAdjusted from './images/IMG_7120.jpg';\n//import natureHikeWide from './images/IMG_7125.jpg';\nimport leadingTrail from './images/IMG_7131.jpg';\nimport mushroom from './images/IMG_7145.jpg';\nimport overlook from './images/IMG_7196.jpg';\nimport overlookWide from './images/IMG_7229.jpg';\nimport deadTree from './images/IMG_7254.jpg';\nimport wideSky from './images/IMG_7281.jpg';\nimport lakeView from './images/IMG_7305.jpg';\nimport singleAloe from './images/IMG_7397.jpg';\nimport flowerField from './images/IMG_7436.jpg';\nimport sky from './images/IMG_7460.jpg';\nimport singleFlower from './images/Livingston_CornerOfFrame_6506.jpg';\nimport leadingRoad from './images/Livingston_LeadingLines_6369.jpg';\nimport nightShot from './images/Livingston_VisceralPrint-6812.jpg';\n\nconst config = {\n  enabled: true,\n  slug: 'digital-photography',\n  title: 'Digital Black and White Photography',\n  shortDescription:\n    'Digital Black and White photography I have done mostly consisting of nature and landscape pictures.',\n  description,\n  type: 'traditional',\n  splashImageUrl: nightShot,\n  images: [\n    {\n      url: largeAloe,\n      title: 'Multiple Large Aloe Plants',\n      description: 'Picture of some Aloe plants on a hike behind my house | Made 2019',\n      dimensions: { height: 1080, width: 1620 },\n    },\n    {\n      url: singleAloe,\n      title: 'Single Aloe Plant',\n      description: 'Picture of a single Aloe plant on a hike behind my house | Made 2019',\n      dimensions: { height: 1440, width: 960 },\n    },\n    // {\n    //   url: natureHike,\n    //   title: 'Nature Hike Photography',\n    //   description: 'Pictures from a hike behind my house | Made 2019',\n    //   dimensions: { height: 1080, width: 720 },\n    // },\n    // {\n    //   url: natureHikeAdjusted,\n    //   title: 'Nature Hike Photography with Adjustments',\n    //   description: 'Pictures from a hike behind my house -

I have always appreciated the immense detail you can find in something as simple as a broken brick wall and when creating these textures for myself, it reminded me of how much effort can go into each aspect of a project. This showed me that even as a single person with limited experience, I could create something photo-real.

Each individual texture has two corresponding 3D and 2D photos, they are all made with a variety of maps including, Albedo, Diffuse, Specular, Gloss, Roughness, Normal, Displacement, AO and Metalness. These are meant to exponentially increase the texture’s fidelity by providing the most realistic form of lighting, shading and texture information.

The piece also consists of a few more abstract sections of the knife that were meant to confuse you as to where they might be located on the actual object.</p>\n\n<hr/>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SwissArmyMinimalist_04.2ccc1420.jpg\";","import description from './description';\nimport MiniatureEffect from './images/miniature.png';\nimport SnowyMountain from './images/snowmountain.jpeg';\n\nconst config = {\n  enabled: true,\n  slug: 'photoshop-projects',\n  title: 'Photoshop Projects',\n  shortDescription: 'Individual Photoshop Projects I have completed as a part of my Art 74 Class.',\n  description,\n  type: 'digital',\n  images: [\n    {\n      url: MiniatureEffect,\n      title: 'Miniature Effect',\n      description: 'Made 2018',\n      dimensions: { height: 560, width: 408 },\n    },\n    {\n      url: SnowyMountain,\n      title: 'Snowy Weather On Mountain Effect',\n      description: 'Made 2018',\n      dimensions: { height: 1100, width: 762 },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n","const description = `<p>These are a few of the miscellaneous projects I have completed with <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Adobe Photshop</a></strong>.

This effect is mainly dependent on the high depth of field and blur to give off a different perspective than the image had originally. Color adjustments were also made in order to sell the miniature vibe as many dioramas of cityscapes have much more vibrant painterly colors than they would in real life.</p>\n\n<p>The second image is originally of a snowy mountain without the snow overlay effects. This was meant as a way for me to demonstrate the control Photoshop has in that you are able to change the lighting and weather completely without disrupting the original image. The effect, much like the miniature is fairly simple with the overlay itself being a noise map with effects added on to make it more realistic. Blur, haze and tint were utilized to further sell the effect by bringing the background into line with what it would look like in a snowing setting.</p>\n\n<hr/>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/miniature.015b51af.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/snowmountain.395a7b13.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SharkSideView.fef35537.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SharkThreeQuarterView.f663ae4c.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SharkThreeQuarterView_02.13e51560.jpg\";","import description from './description';\nimport sharkSideView from './images/SharkSideView.jpg';\nimport sharkThreeQuartersView from './images/SharkThreeQuarterView.jpg';\nimport sharkThreeQuartersView_02 from './images/SharkThreeQuarterView_02.jpg';\nimport sharkTopView from './images/SharkTopView.jpg';\n\nconst config = {\n  enabled: true,\n  slug: 'plastic-sculpture',\n  title: 'Polluted Art',\n  shortDescription: 'A sculpture created with plastic waste and casted metal components.',\n  description,\n  type: 'traditional',\n  splashImageUrl: sharkThreeQuartersView_02,\n  images: [\n    {\n      url: sharkSideView,\n      title: 'Shark Sculpture Side View',\n      description: 'Made 2019',\n    },\n    {\n      url: sharkThreeQuartersView,\n      title: 'Shark Sculpture Three Quarters View',\n      description: 'Made 2019',\n    },\n    {\n      url: sharkThreeQuartersView_02,\n      title: 'Shark Sculpture Alternate Three Quarters View',\n      description: 'Made 2019',\n    },\n    {\n      url: sharkTopView,\n      title: 'Shark Sculpture Top View',\n      description: 'Made 2019',\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n","const description = `<p>This project consists of a single sculpture made from recyclable and self forged materials.
