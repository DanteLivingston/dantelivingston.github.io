Corridor Digital is a group of artists who create narrative and non-narrative skits on Youtube. They have been on the platform for nearly a decade and I have been watching them for almost as long. In more recent times, their use of photoreal VFX and sophisticated editing rivals movie production companies which has always impressed me. I have always been inspired by their work ethic and tenacity in being able to stay at the top of a very turbulent platform for most of their careers.
