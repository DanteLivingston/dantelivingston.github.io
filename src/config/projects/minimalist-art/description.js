const description = `<p>This is a series of art focussed on minimalism and expression through heavy contrast and served as a great project to re-evaluate my ability to communicate solely in black and white. This would later manifest itself again in my digital photography with the core lessons being originally taught to me with this project.</p>

<p>The minimalist spread is a series of line drawings where line weight, patterns and value are emphasized. This makes each individual square unique enough to stand out, yet consistent when viewed as a whole. The other piece in this project, the knife was meant to imitate a generic Swiss army knife and express all of itâ€™s forms within a purely black and white medium. This taught me a lot about value, form and how to express them in a purely minimalist sense. The piece also consists of a few more abstract sections of the knife that were meant to confuse you as to where they might be located on the actual object.</p>
