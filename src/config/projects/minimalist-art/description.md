This is a series of art focussed on minimalism and expression through heavy contrast. It was completed originally as a part of my Art 12, however I have taken the lessons I have learned because of it much further. Being able to create a legible work entirely of black and white is something I would later express further in my digital photography with the core lessons being originally taught to me with this project.

The minimalist spread is a series of line drawings where line weight, patterns and value are emphasized to make each individual square unique enough to stand out, yet consistent when viewed as a whole. The other piece in this project, the **[Swiss Army Knife](https://www.swissarmy.com/us/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/c/SAK)** was meant to imitate a generic knife and express all of itâ€™s forms within a purely black and white medium. This taught me a lot about value, form and how to express them in a purely minimalist sense. The piece also consists of a few more abstract sections of the knife that were meant to confuse you as to where they might be located on the actual object.
