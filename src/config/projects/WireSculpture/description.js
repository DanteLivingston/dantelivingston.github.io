const description = `<p>This is a series of two wire sculptures I originally made as a part of my Art 13 class. They are unique in that they are my first foray into sculpture in entirety unless you count dioramas and miniatures. The sculptures were meant to showcase that even when making something with the bare minimum in terms of materials, you could still create something unique and detailed.</p>

<p>The first sculpture was a simple wire ball to get us familiar with the tools and medium and was meant as a stepping stone to our later sculpture. I found this pretty fun to make overall as it gave me the opportunity to work with my hands which I had been doing less and less as the digital side of my college career was taking up more of my time.</p>

<p>The second sculpture is a replica of a small desktop fan I have and was originally able to stand up on itâ€™s own. However due to having it move across the state it is a little worse for wear. This piece was very challenging to me, as the wire was fairly greasy and the smaller gauge was especially hard to manipulate because of this. Ultimately, the sculpture came out well in the end and really showed off the form of the fan almost exactly to what the original was.</p>
