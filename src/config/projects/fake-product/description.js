const description = `<p>This was a project done through my Art 74 class where we had to make a 3D object in <strong><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop&#39;s</a></strong> 2D tools. It was meant to introduce us to the graphic design side of digital media art as well as expand our knowledge on how we would be able to make a rough 3D object in 2D mediums. I found it fairly interesting because of my own intrigue when it comes to graphic design as a whole. I love the idea of creating a fake product or a redesigned product as a way to ground your own ideas in the real world. This was one of my earliest Photoshop projects and I would love to go back and redesign them again with my current set of skills to see how far I have progressed.</p>
