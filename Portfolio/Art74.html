      <h2>Glitch Project</h2>
      <h5>This was a series of Art we created using glitchy means.</h5>

      <p>I used all sorts of different tricks to get this art to work. We edited image files in notepad and explored image files in audio programs giving massive changes. This project was meant to make a mess of itself, but some of the art actually came out beautifully.</p>

	  <h2>Meme Mashup</h2>
      <h5>A project we worked on mashing up a series of Memes.</h5>
      <div class="MemeMashup">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="MemeMashupFinal.JPG" alt="MemeMashup">
	  </div>
      <p>This project was the mix of a group of memes that I had previously heard of. I mixed them all together in photoshop to create a fun project that also was significant in a modern sense.</p>
      <br>
	  <h2>MineCraft</h2>
      <h5>This was a project we worked on in Minecraft.</h5>
      <div class="Minecraft Project">
	  <img class="img-fluid" src="MinecraftArt.PNG" alt="MinecraftArt">
	  </div>
      <p>For my art project, I chose to create a pixel art of Mario Mushrooms in an Andy Warhol Style. This turned out great, the colors worked well together and it was fun to create. Later on we moved our projects into a 3D gallery that was able to show off our work further.</p>
      <br>
	  <h2>3D Gallery</h2>
      <h5>The follow up to the Minecraft Project</h5>
      <p>This was a project where we imported what we worked on in minecraft into Sketchup. We then created a gallery to put around it to better show off our work where we recorded an animation of a tour within our gallery. The link below leads to the Youtube Video.</p>

	  <h2>Net Art</h2>
      <h5>This project focused on us creating our own websites for people to journey through.</h5>
      <p>My net art project centered around you making the decision of whether or not to move further into a cave. The story featured numerous branching paths and an unreliable narrator that I created to keep you company.<p>
