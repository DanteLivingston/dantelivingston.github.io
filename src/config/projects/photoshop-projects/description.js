const description = `<p>These are a few of the miscellaneous projects I have completed with <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photshop</a></strong>. With Photoshop being such a universal tool, these are two of my older works which each utilize different skill sets within Photoshop as a whole.</p>

<p>The first is an image that has been made to look like a “miniature” diorama would. This effect is mainly dependent on the high depth of field and blur to give off a different perspective than the image had originally. Color adjustments were also made in order to sell the miniature vibe as many dioramas of cityscapes have much more vibrant painterly colors than they would in real life.</p>

<p>The second image is originally of a snowy mountain without the snow overlay effects. This was meant as a way for me to demonstrate the control Photoshop has in that you are able to change the lighting and weather completely without disrupting the original image. The effect, much like the miniature is fairly simple with the overlay itself being a noise map with effects added on to make it more realistic. Blur, haze and tint were utilized to further sell the effect by bringing the background into line with what it would look like in a snowing setting.</p>
