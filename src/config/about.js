const description = `<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Dante Livingston. I am currently a third year Digital Media Art student at San Jose State University. I grew up in San Diego in Southern California and from a very early period in my life, my parents took me hiking and camping. This manifested itself into my love for the outdoors in later years and now I enjoy bringing nature and environmental themes into my work. I consume a huge variety of media from books, movies, foreign media and video games which has given me a wide view of different artforms since childhood. I have always been a media sponge and hope to work in one of the industries related to media production for my career.</p>
