const description = `<p>This is a series of art focussed on minimalism and expression through heavy contrast. It was completed originally as a part of my Art 12 class, however I have taken the lessons I have learned from it much further. Being able to create a legible work entirely of black and white is something I would later express in my digital photography with the core lessons being originally taught to me with this project.</p>

<p>The minimalist spread is a series of line drawings where line weight, patterns and value are emphasized. This makes each individual square unique enough to stand out, yet consistent when viewed as a whole. The other piece in this project, the <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href="https://www.swissarmy.com/us/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/c/SAK">Swiss Army Knife</a></strong> was meant to imitate a generic knife and express all of itâ€™s forms within a purely black and white medium. This taught me a lot about value, form and how to express them in a purely minimalist sense. The piece also consists of a few more abstract sections of the knife that were meant to confuse you as to where they might be located on the actual object.</p>
