Jean Giraud “Moebius” is a french comic artist who has worked with Stan Lee and inspired Hayao Miyazaki. His surrealist style and ability to express detail through a small use of lines sets him apart from many of his contemporaries. I have always appreciated Moebius’ art and his creativity in design is something I will always be seeking to learn from. Although he died in 2012, Moebius' work will be inspiring artists for years to come and still has a profound effect on many abstract and surrealist works.
