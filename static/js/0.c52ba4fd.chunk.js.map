description = `<p>These are a series of texture assets I have made in the program <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://quixel.com/mixer\">Quixel Mixer</a></strong>. Mixer is an alternative to programs like substance painter that has seen a quick and steady rise in terms of its use in triple A movie and game projects. I have always appreciated the insane detail you can find in something as simple as a broken brick wall in modern video games to the point that I had to attempt something similar myself.</p>\n\n<p>This was a personal project that really showed me that even as a single person with limited experience in 3D I could create something photo-real. It also gave me a newfound respect for the texture and environment artists that are often forgotten about as the time you can spend on a floor texture compared to how long someone will actually view it is incomparable. This project also taught me one last lesson in terms of the scope of triple A titles. While I might be able to make textures, 3D models, concept art and some other assets, there are still so many things I am completely unable to do. When working on personal projects now I have very much limited my scope to make them at least realistically doable instead of picturing a whole modern game coming out of my computer alone.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone interested in the more technical aspect of how these textures are made to look photo-real, I will explain here in a bit more detail. Each individual texture has two corresponding 3D and 2D photos, they are all made with a variety of maps including, Albedo, Diffuse, Specular, Gloss, Roughness, Normal, Displacement, AO and Metalness. These are meant to exponentially increase the texture’s fidelity by providing the most realistic form of lighting, shading and texture information. The final textures are also made with a variety of photorealistic <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://quixel.com/megascans\">Megascans </a></strong> from Quixel’s library giving them a photo-real starting point that you then take further.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Links to Programs Used:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'

I found this project actually very fun compared to what I imagined editing to be like and since then it’s pushed me towards creating more video based art instead of just going through other mediums. The editing allowed me to creatively take a walk through my house in an abstract way which was meant to somewhat confuse the audience’s sense of direction despite the architecture being very simple.

While originally this piece did not have a huge amount of meaning for me other than as a learning tool, I find my stance changed now. After being quarantined to the point that I rarely go out with friends and family, going to something like a gallery is out of the question. With that in mind, I’ve found the concept of virtual galleries more and more interesting as a way to capture the traditional experience of showing off art in a wholly digital format. For the creation of the gallery, Sketch-Up was the perfect tool as a lightweight 3D modeler with free use textures and human models for scale.

The audio itself is meant to be a series of sounds you might hear doing everyday “office work” and were meant to be obtained all in a single room.

This was a difficult process for me as I know next to nothing when it comes to music theory, however it was still very fun to do. This was a group project that I completed with my fellow Art 110 Students, Elizabeth Nguyen, Sam Shi and Giovanny Lopez. I created the initial idea for the project and they all contributed ¾ of the audio clips, Elizabeth also created the form and came up with the data entry idea.

With Photoshop being such a universal tool, these are two of my older works which each utilize different skill sets within Photoshop as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>The first is an image that has been made to look like a “miniature” diorama would. This effect is mainly dependent on the high depth of field and blur to give off a different perspective than the image had originally. Color adjustments were also made in order to sell the miniature vibe as many dioramas of cityscapes have much more vibrant painterly colors than they would in real life. </p>\n\n<p>The second image is originally of a snowy mountain without the snow overlay effects. This was meant as a way for me to demonstrate the control Photoshop has in that you are able to change the lighting and weather completely without disrupting the original image. The effect, much like the miniature is fairly simple with the overlay itself being a noise map with effects added on to make it more realistic. Blur, haze and tint were utilized to further sell the effect by bringing the background into line with what it would look like in a snowing setting.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Link to <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Adobe Photshop</a></p>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/miniature.015b51af.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/snowmountain.395a7b13.jpeg\";","import description from './description';\n\nimport crestBox from './images/crestbox.jpg';\nimport crestBoxFlavor from './images/crestboxflavor.jpg';\nimport crestAd from './images/crestadd.jpg';\n\nconst config = {\n  slug: 'fake-crest-product',\n  title: 'Creating a Crest Product in Photoshop',\n  shortDescription: 'A redesign of the Crest box as well as a new product.',\n  description,\n  type: 'digital',\n  images: [\n    {\n      url: crestBox,\n      title: '3D Crest Toothpaste Box',\n      description: '3D design of a Crest Toothpaste Box | Made 2018',\n    },\n    {\n      url: crestBoxFlavor,\n      title: '3D Fake Flavor Crest Toothpaste Box',\n      description: '3D design of a Crest Toothpaste Box with an unique flavor | Made 2018',\n    },\n    {\n      url: crestAd,\n      title: 'Advertisement for the Crest Toothpaste',\n      description: 'Advertisement to go along with the products | Made 2018',\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n","const description = `<p>This was a project done through my Art 74 class where we had to make a 3D object in <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Photoshop&#39;s</a></strong> 2D tools.

Feng Zhu places an emphasis on understanding the fundamentals in order to ultimately create the best design possible. I have been heavily influenced by not only his art, but his way of thinking and have tried to bring much of his thought process into my own work. While he does still work on many high profile projects, he also runs an art school, the FZD School of Design which he founded in Singapore.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Links</p>\n\n<ul><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://fzdschool.com/\">Feng Zhu School of Design</a></p></li><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL\">Feng Zhu&#39;s Youtube Channel</a></p></li><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fengzhudesign/?hl=en\">Feng Zhu&#39;s Instagram</a></p></li><li><p><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://twitter.com/FengZhuDesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Feng Zhu&#39;s Twitter</a></p></li></ul>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_PFP.4801c1e8.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_Work_01.c54d1e2a.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_Work_02.8d6c59ea.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FengZhu_Work_03.84262c36.jpg\";","import description from './description';\n\nimport jeanMoebiusPFP from './images/JeanGiraud_PFP.jpg';\nimport jeanMoebiusCharacter from './images/JeanGiraud_Work_01.jpg';\nimport jeanMoebiusLandscape from './images/JeanGiraud_Work_02.jpg';\nimport jeanMoebiusDesert from './images/JeanGiraud_Work_03.jpg';\n\nconst config = {\n  slug: 'jean-giraud',\n  title: 'Jean Giraud \"Moebius\"',\n  shortDescription:\n    'A French surrealist comic who has worked with Stan Lee and insipired Hayao Miyazaki.',\n  description,\n  type: 'inspiration',\n  splashImageUrl: jeanMoebiusPFP,\n  images: [\n    {\n      url: jeanMoebiusCharacter,\n      title: 'Starwatcher Holding a Crystal',\n      description:\n        'Some of Moebius’ character art that shows his ability to go from blank shapes to areas of very high detail.
