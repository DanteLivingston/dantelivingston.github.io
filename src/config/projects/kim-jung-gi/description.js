const description = `<p>Kim Jung Gi is a Korean artist and cartoonist who has worked on his own comics as well as triple A movies and games. His ability to draw intimately detailed scenes from memory is famous worldwide. I have always been in awe of his work and have been trying to incorporate some of the way he views the world and thinks into my own mindset. He currently works on individual projects for clients as well as his art group, Studio Ani.</p>
