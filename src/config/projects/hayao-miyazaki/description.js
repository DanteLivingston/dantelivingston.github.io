const description = `<p>Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese director, writer, illustrator and animator most famously known for his position as co-founder of Studio Ghibli. I was first introduced to Miyazakiâ€™s work as a child where his storytelling and art style captivated me immediately. The beautiful, fluid animation, anti war and pro environmentalist themes resonated with me on a deep level and influence me to this day.</p>
