  <div class="centered">Really? Curiosity? Well what are you curious about? <br />Hmm...<br /> Caves I suppose? Well... alright.<br />Caves are formed by the dissolution of limestone. Rainwater picks up carbon dioxide from the air and as it percolates through the soil, which turns into a weak acid. This slowly dissolves out the limestone along the joints, bedding planes and fractures, some of which become enlarged enough to form caves.

The largest caves form where water flows onto the limestone from the adjacent impermeable Portishead Formation (Old Red Sandstone), and Avon Group mudstones. The water sinks underground into holes known locally as 'swallets' or 'slockers'. The streams reappear at the base of the limestone outcrop at large springs, for example at Cheddar and Wookey Hole. Over time, the water finds new lower routes leaving some caves high and dry. Some of these have been dug out by cavers.

The dipping Carboniferous limestones have produced a particular style of cave. A typical Mendip swallet cave is developed where a stream sinks underground at the contact between the Avon Group and the Carboniferous Limestone.
