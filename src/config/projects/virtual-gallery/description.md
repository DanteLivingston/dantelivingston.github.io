This virtual gallery was originally made in 2018 as a way to learn the software **[SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/)** and as a way to showcase my Pixel Art in the class, Art 74. While originally this piece did not have a huge amount of meaning for me other than as a learning tool, I find my stance changed now. After being quarantined to the point that I rarely go out with friends and family, going to something like a gallery is out of the question. With that in mind, Iâ€™ve found the concept of virtual galleries more and more interesting as a way to capture the traditional experience of showing off art in a wholly digital format. For the creation of the gallery, Sketch-Up was the perfect tool as a lightweight 3D modeler with free use textures and human models for scale. The pixel art was created in Sketch-Up as well and was meant to be in an Andy Warhol esque style in regards to the colors and how it was presented.
