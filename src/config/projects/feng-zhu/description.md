Feng Zhu is a veteran concept artist who has worked on projects from Transformers to Star Wars. His designs have been seen by tens if not hundreds of millions and his design philosophy has heavily influenced my own thinking. Feng Zhu places an emphasis on understanding the fundamentals in order to ultimately create the best design possible. I have been heavily influenced by not only his art, but his way of thinking and have tried to bring much of his thought process into my own work. While he does still work on many high profile projects, he also runs an art school, the FZD School of Design which he founded in Singapore.
