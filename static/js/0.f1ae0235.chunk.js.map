description = `<p>Aaron Blaise is a creature artist who got his early break working at Disney on movies like The Lion King, Pocahontas and Mulan. He has superb animation and drawing skills, however his ability to render creatures in photoreal detail is almost more impressive to look at. His love for the outdoors is something I wholeheartedly share and the sheer range of his artwork is something I respect so much. Without knowing about him as an individual, my earliest years were undoubtedly influenced by Aaron Blaise’s work on a deep level.

I have always wanted to push towards digital illustration and to improve my skills. However after plenty of attempts with little success translating what I knew from traditional drawing into digital results I would quickly give up. Eventually, my parents ended up getting an Ipad with an <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></strong> for themselves, only for me to find it and start drawing. While before my digital art never looked as good as what I could accomplish in traditional, I was able to fully realize myself digitally within these pieces. They were drawn with an Apple pencil through the program <strong><a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://procreate.art/\">Procreate</a></strong>, as Photoshop on the Ipad is nowhere near as good as the desktop version from what I’ve seen. The characters themselves are all from the Japanese Anime “Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!” which translated to “God’s Blessing on this Wonderful world”, I do not claim for any of their designs to be my own or original. I have always loved the style of animation in it’s colorful nature and fluidity, as well as it’s simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>I first drew Aqua, the goddess with blue hair using the show’s promotional art as reference and made an effort to make a study of it by mimicking things like cell shading, poses, etc. She was the first piece of digital illustration art I have ever made and ultimately, I think she turned out well, but there were definitely lessons taught to me through the process of drawing. I would later iterate and experiment with the next two pieces, the red robed girl, Megumin and yellow armored crusader Darkness. For both of them I attempted to use a more realistic shading method to make them much less stylized. I also created unique poses for them to give them more motion and dynamism as well as to add my own flair. For Kazuma, the green rogue is at the moment my most recent piece, I pushed what I had learned previously even further. I wanted to experiment with more lighting options including using layers to my advantage as well as to really refine my core shading to create a more realistic look. I thought he was fairly successful in the end and shows off some of the growth I have been able to achieve with the limited time I have been working on digital illustration as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Kazuma as well as Darkness and the group image are all works in progress at the moment that I would like to iterate on further.

This showed me that even as a single person with limited experience, I could create something photo-real.

This effect is mainly dependent on the high depth of field and blur to give off a different perspective than the image had originally. Color adjustments were also made in order to sell the miniature vibe as many dioramas of cityscapes have much more vibrant painterly colors than they would in real life.</p>\n\n<p>The second image is originally of a snowy mountain without the snow overlay effects. This was meant as a way for me to demonstrate the control Photoshop has in that you are able to change the lighting and weather completely without disrupting the original image. The effect, much like the miniature is fairly simple with the overlay itself being a noise map with effects added on to make it more realistic.

After being quarantined to the point that I rarely go out with friends and family, going to something like a gallery is out of the question.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, I’ve found the concept of virtual galleries more and more interesting as a way to capture the traditional experience of showing off art in a digital format. For the creation of the gallery, SketchUp was the perfect tool as a lightweight 3D modeler with free use textures and human models for scale. The pixel art was created in Sketch-Up as well and was meant to be in an Andy Warhol esque style in regards to the colors and how it was presented.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<ul><li>Link to <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.sketchup.com/\">SketchUp</a></li></ul>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/GalleryThumbnailCompressed.9a39010c.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FanFrontView.224a3121.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FanSideView.513b1271.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FanThreeQuartersView.e7d62ae3.jpg\";","//digital\r\nimport aaronBlaise from './aaron-blaise/config';\r\nimport corridorDigital from './corridor-digital/config';\r\nimport digitalIllustration from './digital-illustrations/config';\r\n//traditional\r\nimport digitalPhotography from './digital-photography/config';\r\nimport digitalTextures from './digital-textures/config';\r\nimport fakeProduct from './fake-product/config';\r\nimport fengZhu from './feng-zhu/config';\r\nimport glitchArt from './glitch-art/config';\r\n// import videoGallery from './video-gallery/config';\r\n//inspiration\r\nimport hayaoMiyazaki from './hayao-miyazaki/config';\r\nimport interactiveAudioProject from './interactive-audio-project/config';\r\nimport jeanMoebius from './jean-moebius/config';\r\nimport kimJungGi from './kim-jung-gi/config';\r\nimport minimalist from './minimalist-art/config';\r\nimport photoShopProjects from './photoshop-projects/config';\r\nimport plasticSculpture from './plastic-and-metal-sculpture/config';\r\n//other\r\n//import template from './template/config';\r\nimport tools from './tools/config';\r\nimport traditionalInk from './traditional-ink-drawing/config';\r\nimport videoEditingProject from './video-editing-project/config';\r\nimport virtualGallery from './virtual-gallery/config';\r\nimport wireSculpture from './WireSculpture/config';\r\n\r\nconst projects = [\r\n  // Digital Art\r\n  digitalTextures,\r\n  glitchArt,\r\n  digitalIllustration,\r\n  photoShopProjects,\r\n  fakeProduct,\r\n  // videoGallery,\r\n  videoEditingProject,\r\n  interactiveAudioProject,\r\n  virtualGallery,\r\n\r\n  // Inspiration\r\n  hayaoMiyazaki,\r\n  aaronBlaise,\r\n  corridorDigital,\r\n  fengZhu,\r\n  jeanMoebius,\r\n  kimJungGi,\r\n  // Traditional Art\r\n  minimalist,\r\n  digitalPhotography,\r\n  plasticSculpture,\r\n  traditionalInk,\r\n  wireSculpture,\r\n  // Other\r\n  tools,\r\n  // template,\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default projects;\r\n","import description from './description';\r\nimport fanFrontView from './images/FanFrontView.jpg';\r\nimport fanSideView from './images/FanSideView.jpg';\r\nimport fanThreeQuartersView from './images/FanThreeQuartersView.jpg';\r\nimport wireBall from './images/WireBall.jpg';\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n  enabled: true,\r\n  slug: 'wire-sculpture',\r\n  title: 'Wire Sculptures',\r\n  shortDescription: 'A series of two sculptures made entirely of wire.',\r\n  description,\r\n  type: 'traditional',\r\n  splashImageUrl: wireBall,\r\n  images: [\r\n    {\r\n      url: wireBall,\r\n      title: 'Wire Ball Sculpture',\r\n      description:\r\n        'This is the original wire ball sculpture I created and was meant as a testing ground to understand the medium. | Made 2019',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: fanFrontView,\r\n      title: 'Fan Sculpture Front View',\r\n      description: 'Front view of the main fan sculpture I have created. | Made 2019',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: fanSideView,\r\n      title: 'Fan Sculpture Side View',\r\n      description: 'Side view of the main fan sculpture I have created. | Made 2019',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: fanThreeQuartersView,\r\n      title: 'Fan Sculpture Three Quarters View',\r\n      description:\r\n        'Three quarters view of the main fan sculpture I have created, this image shows off depth and form well. | Made 2019',\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default config;\r\n","const description = `<p>This is a series of two sculptures I made when beginning to work with wire as a medium.

I found this pretty fun to make overall as it gave me the opportunity to work with my hands which I had been doing less and less as the digital side of my college career was taking up more of my time. They are my first real foray into sculpture in entirety aside from creating the occasional diorama. The sculptures were meant to be a sort of real world wire frame or line drawing equivalent. I found this effect fairly amusing to create, as the process involved me somewhat literally tracing a three dimensional fan.</p>\n\n<hr/>`\nexport default description\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/MossyRocks_3D.56c9ab78.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/WireBall.5a14256b.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
